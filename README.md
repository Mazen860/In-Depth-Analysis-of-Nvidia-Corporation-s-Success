This project aimed to evaluate Nvidia’s financial health, strategic positioning, and long-term investment potential amid its dominant role in the AI and semiconductor markets. We utilized a combination of financial models, including DuPont analysis, common-size statements, DCF valuation, and relative valuation to assess Nvidia’s performance, risks, and intrinsic stock value. Based on our analysis, we recommended holding Nvidia stock for the next three years to capitalize on its continued innovation and market leadership. All working files, financial models, and analysis are included in the Dataset and Analysis folder, while the final report and presentation are also provided in the repository for reference.
